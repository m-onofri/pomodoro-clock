# Pomodoro Clock

In this project I created a pomodoro clock, that is a useful device to manage your time and improve your productivity.
This project is from freeCodeCamp course and I made it in HTML, CSS and jQuery.


## How to clone the app locally...

Clone the git repository in the folder of your choice:
```
git clone https://github.com/m-onofri/pomodoro-clock.git
```

Go inside the **pomodoro-clock** folder and open the **index.html** file in your favorite browser.


## ...or watch it live!

You can have a look at this app [here](https://m-onofri.github.io/pomodoro-clock/).


## Main features

* In my pomodoro clock you can set the session length in minutes (from 1 to 60 minutes) and the break length in minutes (from 1 to 60 minutes). By default the session length is set to 25 minutes and the break length to 5 minutes.
* There is a start/pause button to start or pause the timer.
* There is a reset button that allows you to stop the timer and reset the session length and the break length to the default values.
* Anytime a session or a break step reaches zero, an alarm sound is emitted.


## Cross-browser consistency 

The project was checked on MacOS in Chrome, Firefox, Opera and Safari, and on these browsers it works properly.
